Interesting things and thoughts about Ruby
- developers find it fun to work with
- it was developed as a "programmer's best friend"
- very high level and dynamic language
- allows code embedding into HTML
- mostly used for web applications
- supports procedural, object-oriented and functional programming
- open source

Ruby's comparison to other programming languages that I know
- quite similar to Python
- no brackets for loops and almost no semicolons, loops ending with "end"
- uses "nil" instead of "null"
- supports single inheritance
