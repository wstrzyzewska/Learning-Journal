FLOWCHARTS are a graphical explanation and representation of steps in a process. They show steps in a sequential order. Different symbols represents different steps in a process. They also contain a short explanation of a step within each symbol.  
  
Flowcharts are used, because it is a clear way to see every step of a process. It is an easy way to visualize steps of a project or an algorithm and check if it is lacking something. It is also a good way to show someone our ideas for a project and it is easier to brainstorm them.
