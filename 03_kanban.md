Kanban – a popular framework used to implement agile and DevOps software developments. It requires full transparency of work and communication in real-time. Work items are represented visually on a kanban board so every member of a team can see the state of work at any time.  
It visualizes both the process (workflow) and the actual work passing through that process. Its goal is to identify problems in process, so you can easily fix them.  
  
Kanban board – a toll designed to help visualize work, limit work-in-progress and maximize efficiency. Its one of Kanban key components.  
Kanban boards use card, column, swimlanes and WIP limits.  
Cards are visual representation of tasks. Each card contains information about the task and status, deadline, etc.  
Columns are representation of a different stages of your workflow. Cards go through them until completion.  
WIP limits restrict amount of tasks in different stages of workflow.
